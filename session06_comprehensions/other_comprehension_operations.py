Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries.
Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design
and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match
your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change to match the new theme.
Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need them. To change the
